            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>30 ounce of potatoes (approximately 800 gr.)</li>
                <li>3 slices bacon, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces (less than one centimeter)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup minced scallions</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons half-and-half</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 C). Spread French fries in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until lightly golden and crips, roughly 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels, reserving some of the bacon grease in the skillet. Slice into 1/4-inch strips.</li>
                <li>Stir butter into the bacon grease and set skillet over medium heat; add scallions and garlic. Cook and stir until scallions are soft and browning, about 5 minutes. Add blue cheese; cook and stir with a spatula until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in half-and-half until sauce is smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit for 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Arrange fries on a plate and drizzle sauce over fries. Sprinkle bacon strips on top.</li>
